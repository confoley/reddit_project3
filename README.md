#### Project Summary

In this project, we will practice two major skills. Collecting data by via an API and then building a binary predictor on text data.

As we discussed earlier in the course, there are two components to starting a data science problem: the problem statement, and acquiring the data.

For this article, your problem statement will be: _What characteristics of a post on Reddit are most predictive of the overall interaction on a thread (as measured by number of comments)?_

Your method for acquiring the data will be scraping the 'hot' threads as listed on the [Reddit homepage](https://www.reddit.com/). You'll acquire _AT LEAST FOUR_ pieces of information about each thread:
1. The title of the thread
2. The subreddit that the thread corresponds to
3. The length of time it has been up on Reddit
4. The number of comments on the thread

Once you've got the data, you will build a classification model that, using Natural Language Processing and any other relevant features, predicting whether or not a given Reddit post will have above or below the _median_ number of comments.

**BONUS PROBLEMS**
1. If creating a logistic regression, GridSearch Ridge and Lasso for this model and interpret the best hyperparameter values.
2. Write the actual article that you're pitching and turn it into a blog post that you host on your personal blog.
3. Collect text comments as well to search for text "buzzwords."

### Requirements

- Scrape and prepare your data using the `requests` library.
- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a random forest, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
- An executive summary of the results you found.
- A 10-12 minute presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience. The reason we say 'semi-technical' is that FiveThirtyEight wants to see how you plan to explain your findings in your article, and their audience is likely readers who are familiar with and interested in data / statistics, but are not experts. This means that if you'd like to talk about your model works you can, but explain what exactly your model does at a high-level.
